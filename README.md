# Instagram Unfollow Automation Tool

This repository contains a Python tool to automate the "unfollow" action on Instagram using the `instagrapi` library. The main goal is to simplify the management of followed profiles, allowing users to easily remove profiles they no longer wish to follow.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes user-provided Instagram account credentials securely and stores them locally.
- **Error Handling**: Automatically handles errors during the "unfollow" process, including connection issues, challenge requests (such as Captchas), and other Instagram-imposed limitations.
- **Ease of Use**: Once configured with the appropriate credentials, the tool automatically performs the "unfollow" action for all profiles that the user is following but are not following back.

## Additional Features Based on Python Code

- **Credential Management**: Stores Instagram account credentials securely in a local file (`secret.txt`), ensuring ease of access without exposing sensitive information in the code.
  
- **Automatic Login and Error Handling**: Attempts to login to Instagram upon running the script, handling potential challenges (like Captchas) by prompting the user to retry later.
  
- **Followers and Following Analysis**: Retrieves the list of followers and accounts being followed by the user, identifying profiles that do not reciprocate the follow.

- **Unfollow Automation**: Automatically unfollows profiles that do not follow back, enhancing user control over their followed list.

- **Follow Automation**: Automatically follows profiles that follow you.
