1# Instagram Unfollow Automation Tool

This repository contains a Python tool to automate the "unfollow" action on Instagram using the `instagrapi` library. The main goal is to simplify the management of followed profiles, allowing users to easily remove profiles they no longer wish to follow.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes user-provided Instagram account credentials securely and stores them locally.
- **Error Handling**: Automatically handles errors during the "unfollow" process, including connection issues, challenge requests (such as Captchas), and other Instagram-imposed limitations.
- **Ease of Use**: Once configured with the appropriate credentials, the tool automatically performs the "unfollow" action for all profiles that the user is following but are not following back.

## Additional Features Based on Python Code

- **Credential Management**: Stores Instagram account credentials securely in a local file (`secret.txt`), ensuring ease of access without exposing sensitive information in the code.
  
- **Automatic Login and Error Handling**: Attempts to login to Instagram upon running the script, handling potential challenges (like Captchas) by prompting the user to retry later.
  
- **Followers and Following Analysis**: Retrieves the list of followers and accounts being followed by the user, identifying profiles that do not reciprocate the follow.

- **Unfollow Automation**: Automatically unfollows profiles that do not follow back, enhancing user control over their followed list.

- **Follow Automation**: Automatically follows profiles that follow you.
## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository to your computer:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cyberpeppe/instatool.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Make the Bash script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x instatool.sh
    ```

### Running the Tool

4. Start the Python script to perform the unfollow automation:

    ```bash
    ./instatool.sh
    ```

5. The program will connect to your Instagram account, retrieve the list of your followers and followings, then perform the "unfollow" action for users who are not following you back.

### Running on Windows (cmd / PowerShell)

If you are on Windows you don't need Linux: the repository includes simple wrappers to run the Python script from cmd.exe or PowerShell.

- Using Command Prompt (double-click or run from cmd): run `instatool.bat`. It will prefer the `py` launcher if available, otherwise `python`.
- Using PowerShell: run `instatool.ps1`. You can also run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\instatool.ps1` if script execution is restricted.

Prerequisites on Windows:

- Python 3.x installed and on PATH, or the Python launcher (`py`) installed.
- Install dependencies once:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notes:

- `instatool.ps1` and `instatool.bat` just run `unfollow.py` from the repository root. Keep `to-unfollow.txt` and any output files in the same folder.
- If your environment uses `python3` as the executable name, edit `instatool.bat` or call `py -3 unfollow.py`.
